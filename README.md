[Random Module docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)

### Usage

* On first keyboard diggit, your time start counting
* You have 60 seconds to type and follow message from the screen.
* After you have grammer error you 'll have Red color markation, that is the information that 
      you need to correct your message to be same as head message.
* When you complete message you will get Green color markation.
* If everything in normal in typing, then you will have same font color as usual.
* After timer count 60 seconds, script stops and calculate parameters and printed on screen:
    - characters per seconds(CPS)
    - characters per minute(CPM)
    - words per seconds(WPS)
    - words per minutes(WPM)
    
    
### Ideas for future improvements

##### This script as any other have always space for improvements.
    
* larger messages for 60 seconds typing 
* Navigate for someone who quick typing, to early stop, if we typed message before timer ends
* Design improvements and many more.
